# Times-Downloader

A downloader that downloads all files from a specific course TIMES portal. 
1.Just run the program, click Login. 
2.Click Choose Directory and choose a empty directory where you want to download the files.
3.Enter the course url in the third textbox and click download (/course/view.php?id=12345)
4.Your files would now be downloaded. Repeat step 3 for all the courses you have.

The ToPDF function isn't really stable and it could possibly mess with all the files you just downloaded. I recommend using a seperate tool for it.
