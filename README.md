### Instructions
A downloader that downloads all files from a specific course TIMES portal. 

1. Run the program. Enter your user id and password. Click Login. 
2. Click Choose Directory (if you have used the program before, choose the folder you chose before. **Choose the parent folder of download.** Skip to step 5).
3. To add a new course, enter the course url in the third textbox and click download (/course/view.php?id=12345).
4. Your files would now be downloaded. Repeat step 3 for all the courses you have.
5. To update new files for the courses you have already downloaded, just click Update and the program will automatically download any newly uploaded file. (Note: If an existing file was updated with the same name, that file will not be downloaded. You will have to delete the course folder and redownload the course).

### Convert to PDF
Converting to pdf requires you to have Microsoft Word, Powerpoint and Excel installed.

The ToPDF function isn't really stable and it could possibly mess with all the files you just downloaded. I recommend using a seperate tool for it.

1. Click ToPDF button.
2. Click Convert.
